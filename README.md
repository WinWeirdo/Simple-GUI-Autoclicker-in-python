# Simple-GUI-Autoclicker-in-python
Simple GUI Autoclicker created in python with some o3-mini help. 

I created this as public project, because idk. I have no idea how github works or something like that. I knwo a little programming and tried my best to create simple autoclicker for everyone use, even if there is a lot of things like that on the internet. I wrote 80% of the code and chat gpt rest, added comments, changed names of fuctions for better understanding the code for everyone and simplified my code a little bit (one line instead of four). I already compiled it using pyinstaller using -F and -w flags. Should work on windows platform.

When starting programm there will be short info about how to use it and will be shown everytime it is opened. You could change it for shorter or longer delay or remove it completly, same with the message. 
There is 3 second delay between clicking start clicking and it starting clicking also you could use F6 button to start the autoclicker and stop it. You could also use ESC button to exit.
